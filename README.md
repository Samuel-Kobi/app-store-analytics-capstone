# 📱 App Store / Play Store Analytics Capstone

This is my final project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate. I explored what makes apps more successful on the Google Play Store using spreadsheet tools to clean, analyze, and visualize the data.

## 🔍 Key Questions
- Do higher ratings lead to more installs?
- Are free apps more downloaded than paid ones?
- Which categories dominate in popularity?
- Does app size or review count affect success?

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Google Sheets
- Formulas, pivot tables, bar and scatter charts

## 📈 Summary of Findings
- Free apps receive significantly more downloads
- Games and Communication are top-performing categories
- More reviews and higher ratings correlate with higher installs
- App size has no strong impact on download numbers
